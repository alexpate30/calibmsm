#' A data frame of 2,279 individuals with blood cancer who have undergone a transplant.
#' This data is identical to the \code{\link[mstate]{ebmt4}} data, except two extra variables have
#' been derived, time until censoring and a censoring indicator, which are required
#' to assess calibration using some of the methods in `calibmsm`. Code for the derivation
#' of this dataset is provided in the source code for the package.
