The goal of calibmsm is to provide a set of tools for producing
calibration plots for validating an existing (i.e. previously developed)
multistate model.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

```

## Getting help

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible
example on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexpate30/calibmsm).

NB TO DELETE - A USEFUL NOTE FOR NOW:: You’ll still need to render
`README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
`devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub
Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example
workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
