<p>This vignette showcases how to manually apply a bootstrap procedure
to estimate a confidence interval for the BLR-IPCW calibration curves
when using a custom function to estimate the inverse probability of
censoring weights. We use data from the European Society for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation <span class="citation">(EBMT 2023)</span>, which
contains multistate survival data after a transplant for patients with
blood cancer. The start of follow up is the day of the transplant and
the initial state is alive and in remission. There are three
intermediate events (<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>: recovery,
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>: adverse event, or <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>: recovery + adverse event), and two
absorbing states (<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>: relapse and
<span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>: death). This data was originally
made available from the <code>mstate</code> package <span class="citation">(Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>We start by reminding ourselves of the EBMT <span class="citation">(Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011; EBMT 2023)</span>
validation datasets <code>ebmtcal</code> and <code>msebmtcal</code>, and
the predicted transition probabilities out of state <code>j = 1</code>
made at time <code>s = 0</code> from the multistate model
(<code>tps0</code>). We also set the time at which we want to evaluate
the transition probabilities <code>t</code>. Please refer to the <a href="https://alexpate30.github.io/calibmsm/articles/overview_vignette.pdf">Overview
vignette</a> for a more detailed description of this data.</p>

</h2>
<p>While the above approach is accessible, it may lead to a misspecified
model for the weights given the user has no control over the choice of
model (Cox model) or the functional form of the predictor variables
<span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Z}\)</span>, where all continuous
variables are assumed to have linear effects on the hazard, and there
are no interaction terms. Potential issues with using the internal
process for estimating the weights is exemplified in the <a href="Evaluation-of-estimation-of-IPCWs.html">Evaluation-of-estimation-of-IPCWs
vignette</a>. We therefore encourage users to explore their data and
produce a more suitable model to estimate the weights. Please see the <a href="https://alexpate30.github.io/calibmsm/articles/overview_vignette.pdf">Overview
vignette</a> for a definition of the estimand of the weights and how to
estimate them.</p>
<p>Once a function for estimating the weights has been defined, the
internal bootstrapping procedure can then be applied with this function
to estimate the weights. This function must contain the parameters that
are in the <code>calc_weights</code> function, even if you do not plan
to use these parameters. These parameters are then specified through
arguments with the <code>w.</code> prefix in <code>calib_msm</code>. The
user specified function may also contain extra parameters not in
<code>calc_weights</code>, and these are specified through the
<code>...</code> argument in <code>calib_msm</code>. We showcase this by
defining a new function <code>calc_weights_manual</code>. For this
example, we define it to be the same as <code>calc_weights</code>
function. In practice, we do not recommend this, as this option is to
allow the user to specify their own function for estimating the weights.
Given our choice of function to estimate the weights, the calibration
curve is the same as that from Figure 1, and the confidence interval is
a similar size.</p>

<p>Finally, we showcase how to run the bootstrapping procedure manually.
This allows users to parallelise their code to reduce computational
time. This is done by using the package <em>boot</em> <span class="citation">(Canty and Ripley 2022)</span> in conjunction with
<code>calib_msm</code>.</p>
<p>We start by creating a permanent object with the predicted risks of
each individual. When the validation cohort <code>ebmtcal</code> is
resampled, the appropriate predicted transition probabilities must also
be resampled from this object.</p>

<p>The calibration curves (with no confidence interval) are now
calculated. We utilise the <code>calc_weights</code> function from
<strong>calibmsm</strong> to estimate the weights, which is the function
used internally. However, in practice the point of this exercise is to
create a better performing model to estimate the weights than the one
from the internal procedure. The vector of weights should have an entry
for every row the validation dataset. For individuals who will not be
included in the landmark cohort, or who are censored prior to time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, these weights can take any value as
they will not be included when the calibration model is fitted.</p>

<p>It is now time to estimate the confidence interval for this curve. We
define a function <code>calc_obs_boot</code> to generate a bootstrapped
calibration curve which is compatible with the <code>boot</code>
function from the <em>boot</em> <span class="citation">(Canty and Ripley
2022)</span> package. Within each bootstrapped dataset, weights are
calculated and then a calibration curve is estimated using
<code>calib_msm</code>. The use of the argument
<code>tp.pred.plot</code> is essential here, to ensure the bootstrapped
observed event probabilities are generated for the same vectors of
predicted transition probabilities. The function is also written to
estimate a curve for the transition probabilities into a specific state
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, as the output for
<code>boot</code> must be a vector, rather than a matrix. This is done
by utilising the <code>transitions.out</code> argument in
<code>calib_msm</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, metadata is added and the appropriate <code>class</code> is
defined so that the data is in the same format as the output from
<code>calib_msm</code>, meaning it can be used with the S3 generic
<code>plot</code>. Note that in this example
<code>assessed.transitions</code> = <code>valid.transitions</code>, but
this may not be the case if you only estimated calibration curves for a
subset of the possible transitions.</p>

<p>The calibration curves with manually estimated confidence intervals
are plotted in Figure 3. This Figure is very similar to Figures 1 and 2.
This is to be expected given we have used the same model to estimate the
weights that is used in the internal procedure, and verifies that the
manual procedure for calculating the confidence interval has been
successful.</p>
