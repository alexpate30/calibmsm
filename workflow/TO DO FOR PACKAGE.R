### Package to do

### 1) Add restricted cubic splines for when using pseudo-values (allows for easier calculation of confidence intervals)
### DONE 2) Add tests for pseudo-values
### 3) Add a wrapper to help with confidence intervals for calc_calib_blr and calc_calib_mlr
### 4) Anything to do around sub-models? i.e. re-write the supp_gcc program
### 5) Add more tests for pseudo-values when rcs type curve is included
