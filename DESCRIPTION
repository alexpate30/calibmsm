Description: Calibration plots for the transition
  probabilities from a multistate model. Calibration plots can also be produced for
  predicted risks from survival models, competing risks models, predicted risks 
  made at landmark follow up times, and predicted risks from landmark super models.
  Calibration is assessed using one of three methods. 1) Calibration methods for 
  binary logistic regression models applied at a fixed time point in conjunction 
  with inverse probability of censoring weights. 2) Calibration methods for 
  multinomial logistic regression models applied at a fixed time point in conjunction 
  with inverse probability of censoring weights. 3) Pseudo-values estimated using 
  the Aalen-Johansen estimator of observed risk. All methods are applied in conjunction
  with landmarking when required.
