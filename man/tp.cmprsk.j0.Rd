\subsection{'tp.cmprsk.j0'}{

A data frame with 2,279 rows and 13 columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Patient indentifier}
\item{pstate1, pstate2, pstate3, pstate4, pstate5, pstate6}{Predicted transition probabilities of transitions into states 1 to 6}
\item{se1, se2, se3, se4, se5, se6}{Standard error of the predicted transition probabilities of transitions into states 1 to 6}
}

\usage{
tp.cmprsk.j0
}
\description{
Used in vignette: Comparison-with-graphical-calibration-curves-in-competing-risks-setting. The predicted transition probabilities
are made at out of state j = 1 at time s = 0, and treat all states as absorbing states.
Data frame containing the predicted transition probabilities out of state j = 1
made at time s = 0, for a competing risks model out of the initial state (see \code{\link{msebmtcal.cmprsk}}).
The predicted transition probabilities were estimated by fitting
a competing risks model to the \code{\link{msebmtcal.cmprsk}} data using a leave-one-out approach.
Code for deriving this dataset is provided in the source code for \code{calibmsm}.
