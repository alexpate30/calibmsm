\value{
\code{\link{calib_msm}} returns a list containing two elements:
\code{plotdata} and \code{metadata}. The \code{plotdata} element contains the
data for the calibration plots. This will itself be a list with each element
containing calibration plot data for the transition probabilities into each of the possible
states. Each list element contains patient ids (\code{id}) from \code{data.raw}, the predicted
transition probabilities (\code{pred}) and the estimated observed event
probabilities (\code{obs}). If a confidence interval is requested, upper (\code{obs.upper})
and lower (\code{obs.lower}) bounds for the observed event probabilities are also returned.
If tp.pred.plot is specified, column (\code{id}) is not returned.
The \code{metadata} element contains metadata including: a vector of the possible transitions,
a vector of which transitions calibration curves have been estimated for, the
size of the confidence interval, the method for estimating the calibration curve
and other user specified information.

\description{
Calculates the underlying data for calibration plots of the predicted transition
probabilities from a multistate model using three methods.
\enumerate{
\item BLR-IPCW: Binary logistic regression with inverse probability of censoring weights.
\item MLR-IPCW: Multinomial logistic regression with inverse probability of censoring
weights, based on the nominal calibration  framework of van Hoorde et al. (2014, 2015)
\item Pseudo-values: Pseudo-values estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator (Aalen OO, Johansen S, 1978).
}
}
\details{
Observed event probabilities at time \code{t} are estimated for predicted
transition probabilities \code{tp.pred} out of state \code{j} at time \code{s}.

\code{calib.type = 'blr'} estimates calibration curves using techniques for assessing
the calibration of a binary logistic regression model (Van Calster et al., 2016).
A choice between restricted cubic splines and loess smoothers for estimating the
calibration curve can be made using \code{curve.type}. Landmarking (van Houwelingen HC, 2007)
is applied to only assess calibration in individuals who are uncensored and in state \code{j} at time \code{s}.
Calibration can only be assessed in individuals who are also uncensored at time \code{t},
which is accounted for using inverse probability of censoring weights (Hernan M, Robins J, 2020).
See method BLR-IPCW from Pate et al XXXX for a full explanation of the approach.

\code{calib.type = 'mlr'} estimates calibration scatter plots using a technique for assessing
the calibration of multinomial logistic regression models, namely the nominal
calibration framework of van Hoorde et al. (2014, 2015). Landmarking (van Houwelingen HC, 2007)
is applied to only assess calibration in individuals who are uncensored
and in state \code{j} at time \code{s}. Calibration can only be assessed in individuals
who are also uncensored at time \code{t}, which is accounted for using inverse probability
of censoring weights (Hernan M, Robins J, 2020). See method BLR-IPCW from Pate et al XXXX
for a full explanation of the approach.

\code{calib.type = 'pv'} estimates calibration curves using using pseudo-values (Andersen PK, Pohar Perme M, 2010)
calculated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator (Aalen OO, Johansen S, 1978).
Calibration curves are generated by regressing the pseudo-values on the predicted transition probabilities.
A choice between restricted cubic splines and loess smoothers for estimating the
calibration curve can be made using \code{curve.type}. Landmarking (van Houwelingen HC, 2007)
is applied to only assess calibration in individuals who are uncensored and in state \code{j} at time \code{s}.
The nature of pseudo-values means calibration can be assessed in all landmarked individuals,
regardless of their censoring time. See method PV from Pate et al XXXX
for a full explanation of the approach.

Two datasets for the same cohort of inidividuals must be provided. Firstly, \code{data.raw}
must be a \code{data.frame} with one row per individual containing the variables for
the time until censoring (\code{dtcens}), and an indicator for censoring \code{dtcens.s},
where (\code{dtcens.s = 1}) if an individual is censored at time \code{dtcens}, and \code{dtcens.s = 0}
otherwise. When an individual enters an absorbing state, this prevents censoring
from happening (i.e. dtcens.s = 0). \code{data.raw} must also contain the desired variables
for estimating the weights. Secondly, \code{data.mstate} must be a dataset of class \code{msdata},
generated using the \code{[mstate]} package. This dataset is used to apply the landmarking
and identify which state individuals are in at time \code{t}. While \code{data.mstate} can be
derived from \code{data.raw}, it would be inefficient to do this within \code{calibmsm::calib_msm}
due to the bootstrapping procedure, and therefore they must be inputted seperately.

Unless the user specifies the weights using \code{weights}, the weights are
estimated using a cox-proportional hazard model, assuming a linear
functional form of the variables defined in \code{w.covs}. We urge users to
specify their own model for estimating the weights. The \code{weights} argument
must be a vector with length equal to the number of rows of \code{data.raw}.

Confidence intervals cannot be produced for the calibration scatter plots (\code{calib.type = 'mlr'}).
For calibration curves estimated using \code{calib.type = 'blr'}, confidence intervals
can only be estimated using bootstrapping (\verb{CI.type = 'bootstrap}). This procedure uses the internal method for
estimating weights, we therefore encourage users to specify their own bootstrapping
procedure, which incorporates their own model for estimating the weights. Details
on how to do this are provided in the vignette \emph{BLR-IPCW-manual-bootstrap}.
For calibration curves estimated using \code{calib.type = 'pv'}, confidence intervals
can be estimated using bootstrapping (\verb{CI.type = 'bootstrap}) or parametric formulae (\verb{CI.type = 'parametric}).
For computational reasons we recommend using the parametric approach.

The calibration plots can be plotted using \code{\link{plot.calib_msm}} and \code{\link{plot.calib_mlr}}.
